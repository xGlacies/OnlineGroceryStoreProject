# OnlineGroceryStoreProject
  In this project we will create a Web Application that may be used by a Customer looking to purchase Grocrey Store Items, as well as an internal Order Processing Person, whose job is to fulfill the on-line orders placed by the Customers.

    A Customer Should be able to:
  I.	Search Grocery Store Products 
 II.	Make a Purchase without creating a Customer Account
III.	Create a new Customer Account
 IV.	Login, Search Products and Make Purchases with their Customer Account
  V.	Change the information in their Customer Account, like Address, etc.
    
    An Order Processing Person Should be able to:
  I.	Login 
 II.	View a list of orders that need to be fulfilled
III.	Change the state of an order from Open to Ready to Shipped/Picked-up

  We will need to complete this Project as a Team.  We will need to start from scratch, that means no database is provided, no code is provided.
